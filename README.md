Summer 15 @CUNY Lehman College: TrainCube Program (http://traincube.com/)

Traincube in a nutshell: 
- 1 week crash course in MEAN Full-Stack dev
- break us up into four teams of three
- bring in two local businesses
- competition between the two teams for each business
- 1 week of development
- presentation

To make our presentation more appealing, I decided to make a companion app for his website (www.albatax.com). 
The app is fairly simple.  It includes ImageButtons that, onClick(), will:
a) go to some webpage
b) try/catch social media app (to his page) or use a browser to go to his social media page
c) open map, use gps to find current location and the destination is his store
d) go to a google form we created for classes he was offering to customers

The app was a late addition to our presentation, so it is a bit unpolished (worked on this for 2 days).
The images in the drawable dir were made to fit the phone we used to present with (Samsung Galaxy Lite).  
I have another version that also fit my Kindle (larger images).

things left to do: 
1) add larger images to drawable dir
2) http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens-distribution.html
